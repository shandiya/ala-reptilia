# Reptiles in the ACT, Australia   

This project explores spatial and temporal aspects of occurrence data for reptiles (Class: Reptilia) in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Data was retrieved from the Atlas of Living Australia using the [`galah`](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah) package, and the R code used for exploratory analyses and creating visualisations is available in the index.Rmd file in this repository. The output of this analysis may be viewed [here](https://shandiya.github.io/ala-reptilia/).
